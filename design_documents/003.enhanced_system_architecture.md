**Type**: Architecture Enhancement  

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced system architecture after implementing the five key enhancements to meet hackathon success criteria.

## Enhanced Architecture

The system now includes additional agents and enhanced capabilities:

```
CodeAnalyzer → TestCaseDesigner → CoverageAnalyzer → TestImplementer → TestRunner(Enhanced) → ReportGenerator → ResultSummarizer
                                                          ↓
                                                    DebuggerAndRefiner
                                                          ↑
                                                    (Iterative Loop)
```

## New Components

- **Tools**: `execute_tests_sandboxed`, `parse_test_results`
- **New Features**:
  - Execution session tracking
  - Reliability metrics calculation
  - Performance monitoring
  - Historical trend analysis

### 3. ReportGenerator Agent
- **Purpose**: Creates comprehensive analysis reports
- **Input**: Coverage report, test results, source code, test code
- **Output**: Comprehensive report with insights and recommendations
- **Tools**: `generate_comprehensive_report`, `format_report_as_markdown`
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-format output (JSON, Markdown)
  - Executive summary with key metrics
  - Detailed analytics and breakdowns
  - Actionable insights and recommendations

## Enhanced State Management

### New State Variables
- `coverage_report`: Coverage analysis results with metrics and gaps
- `execution_metrics`: Real-time execution tracking data
- `reliability_metrics`: Historical performance and success rates
- `comprehensive_report`: Aggregated analysis with insights and recommendations

### State Flow
1. **Code Analysis**: `source_code` → `static_analysis_report`
2. **Test Design**: `static_analysis_report` → `test_scenarios`
3. **Coverage Analysis**: `source_code` + `test_scenarios` → `coverage_report`
4. **Test Implementation**: `test_scenarios` → `generated_test_code`
5. **Test Execution**: `source_code` + `generated_test_code` → `test_results` (with metrics)
6. **Report Generation**: All previous outputs → `comprehensive_report`
7. **Result Summary**: `comprehensive_report` → Final user output
